Here is the list that you made with some things in Beta (Things that are up for review).
I have also moved some things that I think would be good things to actually go through the process in so as to learn how it is done in an efficient (and CodingZeal-ish) manner.

- Deployment (How is it normally done at CZ? What is the balance between cost and services and how is that usually handled with clients?)
- Open source etiquette (Same as above)
